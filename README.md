# MSDS_597_Data_Management_SQL

2 Unit Class

Graduate Level Class

Leeza Sergeeeva

October - December 2021

This is combination of my school work on Data Managment and SQL class (MSDS 597 from USFCA) that I've taken during Fall 2021 semester.

This hands-on course offers an applied, practical introduction to programmatically using data. Students use open source software (Python and SQL) to explore the manipulation of data and are exposed to concepts around loading and saving data, aggregating, joining and applying transformations to different, real-world, data sets.
